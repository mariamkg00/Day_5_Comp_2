## Some logical operators

-   == :does this match?

-   != : do these not match?

-   \>,\<, \<=, \>=

-   &, \| (and, OR)

```{r}
# does four match five?
4 == 5

# does four match four?
4==4

# does four not match five?
4 != 5

#Does 4 match "4"?
4=="4"

#with assigned variables:
cat<- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog


#Is dog greater than cat or is cat less than 20? one or both can be true for it to return true. 

dog > cat  | cat <20

# is dog less than cat and cat == 10
dog < cat & cat == 10

dog < cat & cat > 2 & 4>= dog
```

#Making a bubble chart


ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x= wt, y = mpg))+
  geom_point( aes(size= mpg, color= wt)) +
  labs(x = 'Car weight (1000 pounds)',y ='Gas mileage (mpg)', title= 'Car weight efficiency relationship')
